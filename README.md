Group Members: Chris Kim and Anmolpreet Kandola, period 2
Description: Traditional Monopoly, using advanced data structures that we have learned over the past months in class
Instructions: No additional libraries necessary. Make sure the Gui folder contains all Java files and class files and the board.pde file. Gui.pde file is there, but is irrelevant and can me ignored (serves no purpose). Basically you open the board.pde file. 
Ctrl + R to run. 
The board should open up. 
Click Start to start your turn which also rolls your dice and moves you, then the Check button to see if you are on a Jail/Community Chest/Chance space and the proper actions will occur (no text will indicate this, but it is done). 
Next you can click on the Buy property, which will check if it's buyable. If so, the money will automatically be deducted from your bank, and you will have the property added to your list of properties owned. 
You could also click sell property (will automatically remove the property and then add the money to your account if the action is possible in that you do in fact own the property). 
Then you click the End button, and player 2's turn is started, and they automatically move. 
Then they click Check and you repeat until someone loses.
NOTE: PRICES/RENT (In order) of EACH PROPERTY SPACE IN THE GAME (TO BE USED FOR STRATEGY) and letters are irrelevant:
  d = new Property("Canal St", 100, 5, "w");
	d = new Property("Sunset Blvd", 120, 7,"y");
	d = new Property("Times Square", 120, 7, "y");
	d = new Property("Grand Central", 140, 9, "y");
	d = new Property("City Hall", 140, 9, "y");
	d = new Property("Rock Blvd", 160, 11, "b");
	d = new Property("Box Av", 160, 11, "w");
	d = new Property("CS St", 160, 11, "b");
	d = new Property("Bio Blvd", 180, 13, "b");
	d = new Property("Calc Av", 180, 13, "b");
	d = new Property("Mouse Pad", 220, 15, "w");
	d = new Property("Laptop Condo", 240, 17, "r");
	d = new Property("Silicon Valley", 260, 19, "r");
	d = new Property("New Haven", 260, 19, "r");
	d = new Property("Broadway", 220, 15, "w");
	d = new Property("Lefferts", 280, 21, "m");
	d = new Property("Liberty Av", 300, 23, "m");
	d = new Property("Chambers St", 320, 25, "m");

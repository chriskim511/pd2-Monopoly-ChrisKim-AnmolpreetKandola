CK and AK: June 2, 2014: 
Decided to focus our final project on Monopoly. We have decided to incorporate more features that require additional data structures, like Chance and Community, as well as the traditional property and Go To Jail spots. We also want to add other 'effect' spots on the board which will make the game more interesting and less monotonous. We also want to make a log of events so players can keep track of what they have, and what has happened.

AK and CK: June 3, 2014:
We have planned and mapped out the features and structures we want to use for our project. Tiles on the board: Properties, tax, GO, 'Go to Jail', Chance, Community Chest. We will use a doubly linked list in case a person has to move back and this will also loop the board around. To store the properties owned and money that each person has, we will have a bank account class that also contains properties for each person. Stacks or queues for the community chest/chance cards (when used, the text will be revealed, the effect taken and it will be moved to the bottom of the list, or to the top depending on how we decide to make the list). 

CK: Created the different classes we'll be using for the project

AK: June 3rd, 2014: Created constructors, insatiated variables for account, Monopoly, Board. Realized we need properties to have their own class, where their value can be stored.

CK: June 4th, 2014: 
We have decided on what data structures we plan to use. In terms of the board, we're going to use a doubley linked list. For the maintenance of the random chance and community chest cards, we also plan to use a doubley linked list. However, for the bank account, when we store properties, we have also decided to use a linked list, simply because the amount of properties is negligible for find time. 

AK June 4th, 2014: Started on expiermenting with processing, looking to figure out how to create a board and an interactive environment between the user and the computer. Also trying to figure out how to make the side panel that will display the events that occur in the game.

AK June 5th, 2014: Continued to learn and work on the board (processing). Made the spaces of the board, allocating equal amounts of space, while also learning how to work the color schemes and fill for the individual spaces. I don't understand how to fix the colors, anytime I try to fill, it ends up being a different shade of gray.

AK June 6th, 2014: Continued work on the board. Figured out RGB coloring, and worked on spacing of properties and creating rectangles for spots on the board. Plan to finish this quickly over the weekend and move on to making the community chest and chance cards as well as the board/player classes (linked classes).

CK June 8th 2014: Two player game decided, going to be working on the storage of the data and the game mechanics itself. Unfortunately, I've been busy over the weekend (went on a weekend vaca), so I'm planning to work on Monopoly starting tomorrow after I finish all of this hw I have tonight. 

AK June 8th 2014: Not home for most of the weekend, updated the board, will work on the actual cards and players account next. Still need to learn how to work with text rotation in processing.

CK and AK: June 2, 2014: 
Decided to focus our final project on Monopoly. We have decided to incorporate more features that require additional data structures, like Chance and Community, as well as the traditional property and Go To Jail spots. We also want to add other 'effect' spots on the board which will make the game more interesting and less monotonous. We also want to make a log of events so players can keep track of what they have, and what has happened.

AK and CK: June 3, 2014:
We have planned and mapped out the features and structures we want to use for our project. Tiles on the board: Properties, tax, GO, 'Go to Jail', Chance, Community Chest. We will use a doubly linked list in case a person has to move back and this will also loop the board around. To store the properties owned and money that each person has, we will have a bank account class that also contains properties for each person. Stacks or queues for the community chest/chance cards (when used, the text will be revealed, the effect taken and it will be moved to the bottom of the list, or to the top depending on how we decide to make the list). 

CK: Created the different classes we'll be using for the project

AK: June 3rd, 2014: Created constructors, insatiated variables for account, Monopoly, Board. Realized we need properties to have their own class, where their value can be stored.

CK: June 4th, 2014: 
We have decided on what data structures we plan to use. In terms of the board, we're going to use a doubley linked list. For the maintenance of the random chance and community chest cards, we also plan to use a doubley linked list. However, for the bank account, when we store properties, we have also decided to use a linked list, simply because the amount of properties is negligible for find time. 

AK June 4th, 2014: Started on expiermenting with processing, looking to figure out how to create a board and an interactive environment between the user and the computer. Also trying to figure out how to make the side panel that will display the events that occur in the game.

AK June 5th, 2014: Continued to learn and work on the board (processing). Made the spaces of the board, allocating equal amounts of space, while also learning how to work the color schemes and fill for the individual spaces. I don't understand how to fix the colors, anytime I try to fill, it ends up being a different shade of gray.

AK June 6th, 2014: Continued work on the board. Figured out RGB coloring, and worked on spacing of properties and creating rectangles for spots on the board. Plan to finish this quickly over the weekend and move on to making the community chest and chance cards as well as the board/player classes (linked classes).

CK June 8th 2014: Two player game decided, going to be working on the storage of the data and the game mechanics itself. Unfortunately, I've been busy over the weekend (went on a weekend vaca), so I'm planning to work on Monopoly starting tomorrow after I finish all of this hw I have tonight. 

AK June 8th 2014: Not home for most of the weekend, updated the board, will work on the actual cards and players account next. Still need to learn how to work with text rotation in processing.

CK June 9th 2014: Started the Linked List for the board itself. We're going to have one linked list that represents the board, and the accounts itself will be a linked list. 

AK June 9th, 2014: Finished the board. Included text of the spaces on the board. Created the Commmunity Chest Cards and Chance Cards, will assign integer values and randomized to create decks to be used in the game.

CK June 9th 2014: Updated the Board's Linked list. It'll be nodes composed of properties. The nodes will also contain the information of its position. Still have to sort out this design though. Possibly going to use toString to convert to processing. 

AK June 11th, 2014: Worked on the deck class, creating a community chest deck of cards and chance deck of cards, and methods for pulling them out and then putting them on the bottom of the deck so it can be used throughout the game, and the cards are recycled. I don't understand the errors, which tell me that the strings which include waht each card says are the wrong way to start in the expression ccdeck.add("...") where ... represents what says the card says and ccdeck is the arraylist representing the deck of community chest cards. The errors are duplicated for the chancedeck.

AK June 13,14,15 2014: Attending/serving at a religious function all day (and afterschool Friday).

CK June 14: Was supposed to be the bulk of the time we were going to spend on the project, but unfortunately I was injured and spent a lot of my time at the ER (Email). 

CK June 15: Father's Day Family Gathering

CK: June 16-17: Finished the JAVA portion of the Monopoly game, from the decks to the Accounts and Linked List board. GUI is the last thing we need to do, (which will take a lot of time), and we have allocated time right after our USH regents tomorrow to get it done. 
 
AK June 16-17, 2014: Created Gui, moved all files into processing, editing Decks.java, Account.java (made constructor, fixed random, sent to Chris who was ediiting with processing, all files at once, so we didn't want merge issues). Fixed up final issues on the board itself. All that's left is the Gui file. Community Chest/CHance cards were also fixed and sent. System for turns/actual gameplay will be implemented in Gui. 

AK June 17 2014: Gui the board file is completely irrelevant. In the board file however, the driver (monopoly.java) was integrated by me and the buttons that basically make the game run were created (Start, move, buy/sell, end) and their functionality implemented. All Chris has to do now, is input the functions that he has once he fixes the driver (Monopoly.java) into functions instead of one long main and then it should work, because I told him where each function is supposed to go, like under which button. Also, I wrote the directions.

AK June 17-18 2014: Worked out kinks, made the game print stuff and so button makes sense and user can understand where he/she is and how much money he/she has.
